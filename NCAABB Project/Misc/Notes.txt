Bracket Project Notes (By Ryan Burns):

File specifications:

stats_x_1 is the original data format
stats_x_2 is the ordered data format
stats_x_3 is the trimmed and ordered data format, input this one into the program BracketBuster

2012(1) is common stats
2012(2) is advanced, with GHP, stats
2014(3) is pertinent ESPN stats

Formulas to apply to 2014:

2010 1.0
2010 2.0
2011 1.0
2011 2.0
2012(1) 1.0
2012(1) 2.0
2012(2) 2.0
2013 2.0
Average 1.0
Average 2.0
Everything
High Seeds
Modal (Most common picks, highest seed in ties) (?)
Holistic (Done before any simulations)
Final (Combines intuition and trends from simulations)

Stats to look at adding:

Ken Pom
RPI
BPI
Experience
More exact conference factors
FT%
PPS
Adj. FG%
AST/TO
Strength of schedule
Efficiency (from statsheet.com)
Tons of defensive stats (from statsheet.com)

DO NOT USE 2012(2) TO JUDGE FORMULAS (CONSTANTS LENGTH GETS MESSED UP)

Some Things To Consider:

Currently, there is a variable amount of times that MaxTune gets called, so the time it takes
to run is also variable. To standardize this, we could add formulas to an array of some fixed
length TBD, and then always run MaxTune exactly that many times

Maybe not all variables are linearly related to worth, find plots of each stat's z-score and
find whichever regression fits best and then make a forumla for that

Notes about 2014:

Currrently giving conference factor to Big East and AAC (Look at the effects of that realignment)
