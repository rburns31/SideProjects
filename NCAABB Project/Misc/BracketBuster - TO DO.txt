As of: 1/31/2016

- Create graphs of z-scores vs. worth values to gain insight into each stat's importance
- Re-evaluate conference factors
- Add new evaluation method where the closeness
	of past games affects the chance of winning in the current round
- Add new stats
- Create data sets for 2010(3), 2011(3), 2012(3), and 2013(3)
- Standardize run-times
- Fine-tune the GUI
- Rework the GUI flow so that there are no duplicate years in the drop-down
- On high seeds generation in the GUI, get rid of different versions of the same year
- Move high seeds into the select formula section (maybe re-name to routine?)
- Way to see the actual data through the GUI (manual formulas needs more support)
- Implement modal picks (most picked by the other formulas)
- SERIOUS code clean-up (GUIController, BracketBuster)
- Ability to store new formulas that are made in the GUI
- Clean up the stats' text files when done with a run
- Progress bar cannot be observed because of the calculations, threading?
- Some sense of time on generating a new formula
- Somehow normalize the scaling of coefficients to be in a set range to ease comparisons
- Trim output coefficients
- Ability to input holistic/final/manual selections through the GUI and then save them
- More diagnostic output in text files

- Don't output a score if the worths column is empty (for applying formulas before the tourney)
