- Create graphs of z-scores vs. worth values to gain insight into each stat's importance
- Re-evaluate conference factors

- Add new stats
- Add more historic years (2009, 2008, ...)
- Standardize run-times

- Way to see the actual data through the GUI (manual formulas needs more support)
- Implement modal picks (most picked by the other formulas)
- SERIOUS code clean-up (GUIController, BracketBuster)
- Ability to store new formulas that are made in the GUI (overwrite old formulas)
- Progress bar cannot be observed because of the calculations (threading)
- Some sense of time on generating a new formula
- Ability to input holistic/final/manual selections through the GUI and then save them
- Don't output a score if the worths column is empty (for applying formulas before the tourney)
- Can't type in negative signs or decimal points in the manual formula fields until a number is already there
- Automate the data collection process (HTML scraping?)
- Some weird error being thrown on manual formula entry
- Populate the save file name field with the last run formula name

- Re-evaluate the headers on bracket print

Useful Excel commands:
=VLOOKUP($A62,$Z$2:$AG$348,2,FALSE)
=LEFT(AI2, FIND( "-", AI2) - 1)
=(L2-AVERAGE(L$2:L$65))/STDEV(L$2:L$65)
=VLOOKUP($A2,Sheet1!$A$2:$U$65,B$67,FALSE)
